First step:
- Create a blank* image without number and croped images for all the numbers from the briefcases.
- Create a script to create a bunch of training samples to know where the biggest number is. (Should we find all the numbers?)
    - How do we write to an image?
- Store the images inside a folder, remember the order when created and the desired output of the model.

Second step:
- Train a model to know the position of the briefcases

Third step: 
- Figure how to feed a video into another model?
- Train a model frame by frame to follow the position of the briefcase?

Fourth step:
- Ensure the model is robust.
- Maybe generate more samples by altering angles or quality

Fifth step:
- Test program videoing the screen with the phone.
